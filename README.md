Here are all the codes for the paper "Dissimilation of synonymous codon usage bias in virus-host coevolution due to translational selection".  Details of explaination method for these paper, please see our Nature Ecology & evolution paper.  

2) "fig2A-B.final.R" is the code for fig2 and figs5.  Using this code, you can get how we procede the raw ribo-seq density data and the method of how to calculated these mathematical parameters, such as "RTSV", "rrt (relative decoding time)", "TDT (typical decoding time)", "Sensitivity (sensitivity of codons after the infection of Flu virus)".

The final datasets for fig2 and figs5A-B were saved as "finaldata_forfig2.correlations.Rdata".  Using this data, you can get the
translation seletion landscape of 61 codons caused by virus infection.

Note that, the pattern in figs5c calculated by 8 highly expression genes also showed the patterns we displayed in fig2 and figs5 can't be explained by the small genome of virus.  Again, if you want to know the distinct logic, please see our paper.
